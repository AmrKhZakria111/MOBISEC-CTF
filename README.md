# MOBISEC CTF Challenges - Android Reverse Engineering

This repository contains my notes and solutions for the **MOBISEC CTF** challenges, focusing on Android reverse engineering. The challenges cover a variety of tasks, such as:

- Analyzing and decompiling Android apps
- Reverse engineering APKs to understand their functionality and find vulnerabilities
- Manipulating app behavior and extracting sensitive information
- Using tools like JADX, Ghidra, and Frida for dynamic analysis

Iâ€™ve compiled detailed steps, explanations, and techniques I used to solve these challenges, which will help anyone interested in learning about Android reverse engineering.
